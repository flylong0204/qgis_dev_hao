# qgis_dev
a basic qgis-based standalone application

This repository is mainly for sync with my [bolg papers about QGis development](http://blog.csdn.net/deirjie?viewmode=list). And is mainly focused on the topics of basic GIS functions such as:

* displaying GIS dataset(vector and raster).
* linking the map canvas with layer tree manage view.
* searching information like spatial coordinate system, projection, dataset table, and so on.
* editing datasets, including dataset table editing, shape editing, and so on.
